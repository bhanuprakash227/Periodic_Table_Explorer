# 🌐 Periodic Table Explorer
Periodic Table Explorer is a simple, interactive web application that allows users to explore the elements of the periodic table in multiple ways — by atomic number, element name, comparison, or through a quiz mode. This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is suitable for chemistry learners and enthusiasts.

# 🚀 Features
🔍 Lookup by Atomic Number – Enter an atomic number (1–118) to get the details of the corresponding element.

🔍 Lookup by Element Name – Enter the full name of the element to see its properties.

🔎 Compare Elements – Compare the atomic number, symbol, mass, and block of two different elements side by side.
